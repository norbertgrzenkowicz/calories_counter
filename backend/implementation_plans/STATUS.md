# Barcode Scanning Implementation Status

## Overall Progress: Phase 1 Complete ✅

---

## Phase 1: Add Barcode Scanning Library ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ Done  
**Duration**: Completed  

### Tasks Completed:
- ✅ Added `mobile_scanner: ^5.2.3` to pubspec.yaml 
- ✅ Created `BarcodeScannerScreen` widget with camera preview
- ✅ Integrated into existing `AddMealScreen` with a "Scan Barcode" button
- ✅ Added barcode detection for EAN-13/UPC formats with custom overlay

### What Works:
- Barcode scanning screen with custom overlay and flash toggle
- Integration in AddMealScreen with visual feedback
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Support for food-specific barcode formats (EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E)

### Changes Made:
- Added mobile_scanner dependency to pubspec.yaml
- Created new BarcodeScannerScreen with custom QrScannerOverlayShape
- Modified AddMealScreen to include barcode scanning functionality
- Added visual indicator when barcode is scanned

## Phase 2: OpenFoodFacts Integration ⏳ PENDING
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  

### Planned Tasks:
- ⏳ Create `OpenFoodFactsService` class for API calls
- ⏳ Add simple HTTP-based product lookup by barcode
- ⏳ Parse nutrition data from API response
- ⏳ Add fallback handling for products not found

---

## Phase 3: Supabase Schema Extension ⏳ PENDING
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  

### Planned Tasks:
- ⏳ Add `cached_products` table to existing Supabase database
- ⏳ Extend `SupabaseService` with product caching methods
- ⏳ Implement 7-day cache expiry with automatic cleanup

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Polish ⏳ PENDING
**Status**: ⏳ Pending  

### Planned Tasks:
- ⏳ Connect barcode scanning with OpenFoodFacts lookup
- ⏳ Populate nutrition fields automatically from barcode scan
- ⏳ Allow user to verify/edit barcode-derived values
- ⏳ Add comprehensive loading states and error handling

---

## Key Architectural Decisions Made:
- ✅ **Library Choice**: mobile_scanner for proven reliability and simple setup
- ✅ **Database Strategy**: Will use existing Supabase (not SQLite) for consistency
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing meal flow
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## Next Steps:
1. **Phase 2**: Implement OpenFoodFacts API integration
2. **Phase 3**: Add Supabase caching layer
3. **Phase 4**: Complete end-to-end integration

## Notes:
- Phase 1 completed successfully with no architectural changes needed
- Existing camera functionality remains unchanged
- Ready to proceed with OpenFoodFacts API integration
